# 🛠 XooHooX Dev Pack – Backend Handoff for CursorIDE

## 📦 What's in This Folder?

This development pack contains all the base files needed to scaffold a backend system for the XooHooX prototype (80+ screens from Uizard).

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `batch.json`, `evaluation.json`, `yeast.json`  
  JSON schema files that define the structure of the data. These can be used to scaffold forms, validate API input, or build DB models.

- `batch_model.py`, `evaluation_model.py`, `yeast_model.py`  
  Python files using Pydantic (for FastAPI or Django with Pydantic). These serve as the foundation for request/response validation.

- `openapi.yaml`  
  A complete OpenAPI 3.0 spec. Can be imported into Swagger, Redoc, Postman, or used with tools that auto-generate API route scaffolds.

---

## 🔧 How to Use in CursorIDE

1. **Unzip this pack inside your FastAPI or Django backend repo.**

2. Use the Python model files to define API routes.

Example (FastAPI):

```python
from batch_model import Batch
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/api/batch/dispatch")
def dispatch_batch(batch: Batch):
    return {"message": "Batch received", "data": batch.dict()}
```

3. Use the `openapi.yaml` file to auto-generate routes or documentation:

> Cursor Prompt:
> "Use `openapi.yaml` to generate scaffolded API endpoints."

4. Use the JSON schema files to scaffold database models or form validators.

## 🧪 Next Steps

- Add SQLAlchemy models for DB persistence
- Connect to a Postgres or SQLite database
- Add auth layer with user roles
- Implement remaining endpoints:
  - Grant Tracker
  - Invoicing
  - Report Generator
  - Sample Tracker
