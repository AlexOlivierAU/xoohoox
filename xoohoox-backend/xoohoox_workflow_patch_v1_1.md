# üîß XooHooX Workflow Delta Patch Plan (v1.1 Update)

This document highlights gaps between our current fermentation/distillation workflow and the detailed procedures found in **Testing protocols & Process v2.pdf**. It is designed for Zara.X to track and verify full alignment with project intent.

---

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented (No Action Needed)
- Test 1, 3‚Äì7 fermentation + distillation ladder
- Chemistry correction (SG, pH)
- Nutrient & yeast stages
- Distillation upscale logic (1L ‚Üí 5L ‚Üí 30L ‚Üí 100L)
- ABV tracking (~8%)
- Ferment kinetics monitoring
- D2 Reflux/Infuse as optional
- Still Waste check (Test 8)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Components to Add

### 1. **Test 2 ‚Äì Vinegar Branch**
- Add logic for vinegar path when viable
- Include pH, sensory, and compound analysis (Esters, Ketones, Aldehydes)

### 2. **ABV Rule for Vinegar Mother**
- Vinegar path requires 8‚Äì13% ABV to proceed
- Mark this as a branching rule in logic

### 3. **Juice Processing Variants**
- JP1‚ÄìJP5:
  - JP2: Whole Fruit Macerate Juice
  - JP3: Pressed Juice
  - JP4: Extractor Juice
  - JP5: Optional variations
- Document which variant is used per test

### 4. **Compound Analysis Expansion**
- Add post-distillation testing for:
  - Vanillin
  - Fusel Oils
  - Turpines
  - Ketones / Aldehydes
  - Esters
  - Glycerol
  - VOCs

### 5. **Stage 2 (Post Test 6)**
- Placeholder in current doc ‚Äî needs defining
- Include decision logic based on SDLC & MegaQuant results

### 6. **One-Time Raw Juice Ferment Rule**
- Add rule: Raw Juice Ferments (JP1) are conducted **once only** per fruit
- No SG/pH adjustment allowed

### 7. **Fruit Performance Report**
- Track:
  - Avg Gross Fruit Weight
  - Juice Yield per gm
  - BRIX
  - YAN
  - pH
  - Starch
  - Sensory evaluation

## üìå Zara.X Action Points

Zara should verify:
- All the above fields are added to our workflow tracking
- Branching logic is clear (Vinegar path, Stage 2 escalation)
- Future PDFs or sketches are matched against this checklist
