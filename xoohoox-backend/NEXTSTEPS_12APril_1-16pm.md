# Next Steps Before UI Mockup Creation - April 12, 2024

## Pre-Mockup Tasks

### 1. Backend API Completion
- **Current Status**: We have database models and schemas, but need to ensure all necessary API endpoints are implemented
- **Required Actions**:
  - Complete the API endpoint implementation for batch management
  - Finalize the quality control data endpoints
  - Implement inventory and equipment management APIs
  - Ensure all data needed for the UI is available through the API

### 2. Data Structure Validation
- **Current Status**: We have models defined, but need to validate the data structure meets UI requirements
- **Required Actions**:
  - Verify all required fields for batch creation are available
  - Confirm quality control metrics can be properly visualized
  - Ensure environmental monitoring data is structured for real-time display
  - Validate that equipment status data is comprehensive enough for the dashboard

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- **Current Status**: Basic authentication is implemented, but role-based access may need refinement
- **Required Actions**:
  - Define user roles and permissions clearly
  - Ensure the backend supports role-based access control
  - Document which UI elements should be visible/editable by each role

### 4. Real-time Data Requirements
- **Current Status**: Need to determine which data needs real-time updates
- **Required Actions**:
  - Identify which components need WebSocket connections
  - Define the real-time data structure
  - Ensure the backend can support real-time updates for critical metrics

### 5. Integration Points
- **Current Status**: Need to clarify how the UI will integrate with existing systems
- **Required Actions**:
  - Document any third-party integrations needed
  - Define data import/export requirements
  - Identify any external APIs the UI will need to consume

### 6. User Workflow Validation
- **Current Status**: We have outlined user flows, but need to validate them against actual processes
- **Required Actions**:
  - Review the outlined user flows with actual users
  - Validate that the proposed UI components match real-world workflows
  - Identify any missing steps or edge cases in the current flow diagrams

### 7. Technical Constraints
- **Current Status**: Need to identify any technical limitations that will affect the UI design
- **Required Actions**:
  - Document browser compatibility requirements
  - Define performance expectations for data loading
  - Identify any limitations in the current backend that might affect UI design

### 8. Content Requirements
- **Current Status**: Need to gather all content that will appear in the UI
- **Required Actions**:
  - Collect all error messages and notifications
  - Define help text and tooltips
  - Gather any static content that will appear in the UI

## Next Steps Before Mockup Creation

1. **Backend API Review**:
   - Review the current API implementation
   - Identify any missing endpoints needed for the UI
   - Document the API structure for the UI team

2. **User Flow Validation**:
   - Present the current user flows to stakeholders
   - Gather feedback on the proposed navigation
   - Refine the flows based on feedback

3. **Data Requirements Documentation**:
   - Document all data points needed for each UI component
   - Verify that the backend can provide this data
   - Identify any data transformation needed

4. **Technical Requirements Gathering**:
   - Define browser support requirements
   - Document performance expectations
   - Identify any technical constraints

5. **Content Gathering**:
   - Collect all text content for the UI
   - Define error messages and notifications
   - Gather help text and documentation

## Priority Order

1. **Highest Priority**:
   - Backend API Review
   - User Flow Validation
   - Data Structure Validation

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Technical Constraints
   - Content Requirements

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Real-time Data Requirements
   - Integration Points

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Backend API Review, User Flow Validation
- **Week 2**: Data Structure Validation, Authentication & Authorization
- **Week 3**: Technical Constraints, Content Requirements
- **Week 4**: Real-time Data Requirements, Integration Points

## Notes

- All tasks should be completed before UI mockup creation begins
- Each task should have a designated owner
- Regular progress updates should be provided
- Any blockers should be identified and addressed immediately
