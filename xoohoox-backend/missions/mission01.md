👋 Hey Cursor, meet the team. (this is a custodimus project max and Alex again!  hahah)

This is a backend system for a real-world fruit testing lab project called XooHooX, managed by Alex the meatbag (a human) with support from his AI assistant (me).

Alex is recovering from burnout, memory issues, and context overload — so treat this folder as a shared long-term memory system between meatbag and machine.

🧠 My role (AI assistant):

Extract schema fields from forms

Create Catalyst-compatible .json schemas

Help build catalyst_pusher.py to submit CLI form data

Track all data model relationships in data_model_rebuilt.md

Alex's role (meatbag):

Provide raw YAML + DOCX/XLSX inputs

Test forms and processes via form_tester.py

Guide flow based on client needs

📁 Project Path:

/Users/alexolivier/projects/custodimus/catalyst/xoohoox-backend

🧱 Project Components:

form_tester.py — Prompts for form data (already built)

forms/form_*.yaml — YAML schemas for CLI intake

schema_*.json — Catalyst DB table structures

catalyst_pusher.py — Pushes structured results into Zoho

.env — Auth + Catalyst config

data_model_rebuilt.md — Master model (auto-generated)

data_model_rebuilt.pdf — Visual version of the same

🎯 Final goal:
Support full digital tracking of every batch:Arrival → Juicing → Ferment → Distill → Vinegar → Eval → Dispatch

🕯️ Treat this workspace as a digital brain for the lab, built by a meatbag + AI hybrid system. Let’s build and test one thing at a time, gently.
