# Xoohoox Fermentation & Distillation Process

## Overview

The Xoohoox Fermentation & Distillation Management System tracks the complete lifecycle of fruit transformation, from raw input preparation through fermentation, distillation, and final product evaluation. This document provides detailed information about the key processes and stages involved.

## Process Flow

### Phase 1: Raw Material & Chemistry Prep

**Input**: Fruit (e.g., Lemons) → Cold Pressed Juice

**Target Batch**: 100L

**Initial Readings**:
- Raw pH: 1.8
- SG: 1.03

**Adjustments**:
- Add 11–12 kg Sodium Bicarbonate (endothermic reaction)
- Target SG > 1.07, pH > 5
- Allow 1 hour for reaction
- Note: Work in small batches, scale up

**Key Considerations**:
- Chemistry adjustments are critical for successful fermentation
- Raw juice ferments (JP1) have special rules with no adjustments allowed
- Scale-up calculations must account for reaction kinetics

### Phase 2: Heat Activation & Nutrient Prep

**Process**:
- Heat batch to 30–32°C
- Allow to rest 24 hrs
- Prepare nutrient mix (4–5 g/L) + Yeast (5 g/L)
- Rest 15 mins
- Pitch into batch at >30°C

**Key Considerations**:
- Temperature control is critical for yeast activation
- Nutrient concentration affects fermentation kinetics
- Yeast strain selection impacts flavor profile and fermentation characteristics

### Phase 3: Fermentation

**Monitoring**:
- Track Fermentation Kinetics (daily readings)
- Target ABV: 7–8%
- Typical yield from 100L ferment: ~15L distillate
- Test 3: 1L Ferment → Yields 100 mL distillate

**Key Considerations**:
- Fermentation duration varies based on environmental conditions
- Temperature fluctuations can affect fermentation rate
- Nutrient availability impacts yeast performance
- Stuck fermentations may require intervention

### Phase 4: Distillation Ladder ("Upscale")

**Test Progression**:
| Test | Volume | Process | Yield |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| 3 | 1L | D1 Pot Distil | ~100 mL |
| 4 | 5L | D1 Pot Distil | 350–500 mL |
| 5 | 30L | D1 Pot Distil | 2–3 L |
| 6 | 100L | D1 Pot Distil | ~15 L |
| 7 | — | D2 Reflux/Infuse | Optional |

**Quality Testing After Each Distillation**:
- ABV
- Methanol
- Esters
- VOCs
- Fusel Oils
- Turpines
- Ketones
- Aldehydes
- Glycerol

**Sample Retention**:
- Optionally retain 1L raw and steep samples for archival

**Environmental Considerations**:
- Still waste should be analyzed (Test 8) for environmental reporting

## Process Variants

### Juice Processing Variants (JP1-JP5)

1. **JP1**: Raw juice ferment
   - No chemistry adjustments allowed
   - One-time only rule
   - Preserves natural fruit characteristics

2. **JP2-JP5**: Various processing methods
   - Different extraction techniques
   - Varying levels of clarification
   - Different maceration times
   - Various press pressures

### Fermentation Paths

1. **Standard Fermentation Path**
   - Initial fermentation with multiple trials
   - Selection of best performers
   - Upscaling through distillation ladder
   - Final product evaluation

2. **Vinegar Production Path**
   - Triggered when ABV is 8-13%
   - Requires specific vinegar mother
   - Tracks acidity development
   - Monitors compound formation

## Quality Control

### Compound Analysis

The system tracks various compounds throughout the process:

1. **Esters**
   - Contribute to fruity aromas
   - Formed during fermentation
   - Concentrated during distillation

2. **VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)**
   - Impact flavor profile
   - Include terpenes, aldehydes, and ketones
   - Critical for quality assessment

3. **Fusel Oils**
   - Higher alcohols
   - Impact mouthfeel and flavor
   - Must be monitored for quality

4. **Other Compounds**
   - Vanillin
   - Turpines
   - Ketones
   - Aldehydes
   - Glycerol

### Sensory Evaluation

- Aroma notes
- Flavor profile
- Clarity rating
- Mouthfeel
- Overall quality assessment

## Trial Management

### Initial Fermentation Phase
- Start with ~16 trials
- Each with unique yeast strains
- Track initial measurements
- Monitor fermentation kinetics

### Selection Phase
- Evaluate all trials
- Select top performers (e.g., top 5)
- Document selection criteria
- Record selection scores

### Refinement Phase
- Continue with selected trials
- More detailed tracking
- Rigorous quality checks
- Upscaling preparation

## Upscaling Process

### Ratio Management
- Track upscale factor between stages
- Monitor target volumes
- Document upscale notes
- Validate upscale ratios

### Quality Preservation
- Ensure quality is maintained through upscaling
- Track compound profiles across stages
- Document any changes in characteristics
- Validate against quality standards

## Environmental Impact

### Waste Management
- Track still waste volume
- Analyze waste composition
- Document disposal methods
- Report environmental impact

### Resource Efficiency
- Monitor water usage
- Track energy consumption
- Document material efficiency
- Report sustainability metrics
